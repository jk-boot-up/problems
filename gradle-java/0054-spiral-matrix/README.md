# 54. Spiral Matrix

**Difficulty:** Medium &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Topic:** Matrix &nbsp;|&nbsp; [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/)

## Problem

Given an `m × n` matrix, return all of its elements in **spiral order** (clockwise, starting at the top-left).

**Example 1**
```
Input:  [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```

**Example 2**
```
Input:  [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
```

**Constraints**
* `1 <= m, n <= 10`, `-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100`

## Solutions

One solution, in subproject `v1`.

| Version | Approach | Time | Space | Animation |
|---------|----------|------|-------|-----------|
| [v1](v1/README.md) | Shrinking boundaries | `O(m·n)` | `O(1)` | [▶ animation](v1/animation/index.html) |

## Build and test

Only a JDK is needed to start Gradle; JDK 25 is downloaded automatically if it is missing.

```bash
./gradlew test          # every version
./gradlew :v1:test      # one version
```

## Animation

Open `vN/animation/index.html` in a browser. It has three tabs:

* **Problem:** the statement and the key idea.
* **Walkthrough:** pick a scenario and press **Play**. Each step is animated and read aloud by your browser's speech engine
  (untick *Narration* to mute). Keys: space = play/pause, ← / → = step, 1–9 = scenario.
* **Complexity:** time and space cost, plotted against the common growth curves, and compared across versions.
